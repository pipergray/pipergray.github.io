Hello ^-^
=========
   I've just learned how to program. This website will hopefull one day be my blog, but for now is more of a test/learning tool. What do you think of the color? I personally like the pink/purply feel to it. Also, what should I make this a blog of????

   The site is rather blank right now but hopefully(as I learn more) it'll turn out a bit more Piperish and colorful. '
